R_2rFhaVkFRTxy8M5,"As athletes often put the game or the team before ourselves. We feel the pressure to push through issues that we have because we can manage them on our own. Our health is the number 1 priority for the team and more so ourselves. If we are not at 100% then we are not able to help the team, in the extreme we can cause further harm to ourselves or a teammate.     When you feel that you have had an injury say something to a medical professional. The injury might be something small. In the case that is more serious, like a concussion, you will have started the process earlier and will be able to return to normal health quick thus return to play.",c3,124
R_8ljyaWB28tpLGyV,"There are a lot of outcomes for someone who doesn't tell and someone who does tell about a possible concussion. If you don't tell someone, you will feel worse and potentially experience higher levels of depression. You will also perform poorly academically and athletically and it will take a longer time to recover from this. On the other side, if you do tell someone you can receive treatment to let your brain rest and recover and return to your activity and every day life. When you are in doubt, it is better to get it checked out because it is better miss one game than an entire season.     The short story from the Yale hockey player shows that she realizes that she should have followed her instincts that there might be something wrong with her head. Since she didn't tell anyone, she had a longer recovery and a more difficult time getting back into the game. She advises all athletes to get it checked out if you are worried about a possible head injury or concussion.",c3,176
R_b8IkALtJKIXRejX,"When deciding whether or not to report a possible concussion, it's important to understand the consequences of either decision.  If untreated, concussions can have serious long-term effects such as decreased athletic ability, depression, or even a second hit leading to death.      These risks show why it's important to report a possible concussion, despite pressure to push through the pain.  Seeking medical attention can seriously improve symptoms and prevent long-term problems associated with head trauma.",c3,74
