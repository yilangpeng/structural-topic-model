R_5sYIlFJxMFGFlvn,"As an athlete who deals with general anxiety disorder, I hope I remember that if I think I have a concussion, I should tell somebody. If I don't, and try to play through it, I could make my mental health issues even more severe, which has the potential to damage friendships and relationships. Missing a few games is better than hiding a potential concussion and making my mental health worse.     Moreover, I hope that I remember that playing through a concussion does not make me tough. Of course it is hard to take yourself out of a game and not play, especially as someone as competitive as myself, but ignoring a concussion has long-lasting negative implications. Missing a game or two is much better than causing long term damage to my brain.",c3,132
R_1XJEp2NQbX3Ex7f,"A concussion is very hard to diagnose, so right when you are feeling any type of symptoms you should get it checked out. Some of the symptoms to be cautious of are a lasting headache, nausea, sensitivity to light/noise, dizziness, and lack of balance. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms you should tell someone right away.   Since a concussion is very hard to diagnose, it is important to go to a doctor or someone of greater knowledge on the subject right away. It is dangerous to live a normal life while dealing with a concussion so you want to get the right advice as soon as possible.",c2,109
R_2fBnos3ZOSS0fA1,"Taking away from this video, I would tell myself to always be aware of the symptoms of a concussion. Whether be a headache, irritability, or loss of balance, I should always consider a concussion to be a possibility. Furthermore, if I feel that I have a concussion in the slightest bit, I should not be afraid to tell somebody. It is better to let somebody no about the potentiality of having a concussion rather than dealing with the lasting consequences. Another thing to consider includes safer alternative methods and practices. I should always be looking for safer ways to perform tasks in order to decrease the likelihood of receiving a concussion.",c2,111

If any of those are occurring make sure to reach out for help. It can be difficult to self analyze the degree of damage from a hit to the head because you may not think that all the effects are related. I suggest that if you feel more slowed down or sluggish to make sure to find assistance. It is much better to be safe with these symptoms by getting checked out for a concussion rather than letting it go.",c2,110
R_6WEmJK0VF1TMDit,Concussions are very dangerous and can change your life. They can be especially dangerous when gone unreported because getting hit while currently concussed can cause major damage and even death. Boxing is not a sport to be messing around with concussions because the chance of getting hit in the head next time you step in the ring is 100%. You are not Floyd Mayweather.       If you ever think you might have a concussion please let Marcus or a doctor know. They will take the correct steps to prevent further or long term damage from occurring.

You may play sports for a decent amount of time, but you will have to live with the consequences of what happened while playing sports for the rest of your life. Your ability to think and reason is what got you to this point in life. Suffering a concussion and then not telling anyone about can take those abilities you value away.    You got lucky when you got knocked out in that fight. Your coach saw you suffer a concussion and took the decision to hide or report out of your hands. You're fortunate that she saw it because there's a good chance you wouldn't have told anyone about your symptoms and would've gotten back in the ring a week later and left yourself very susceptible to suffering another traumatic brain injury.",c3,149

R_cU97boA0emCXhNH,"At times, it can seem simple to try and be a ""tough guy"" and not tell anyone about possible concussion like symptoms you may be having. However, the risk is just not worth the reward. Even if you continue to play in an athletic event, your performance will be severely reduced, as concussions lead to decreased athletic ability. Some of the other dangers include long term effects to your health and well being along with a prolonged recovery time if you do not seek proper care.    If you do tell someone immediately, you will be given the chance to receive proper care and diagnosis. This will allow you to get the rest you need to give your brain a chance at recovery. This will cause your recover to be faster and quicker, while at the same time limiting the long term effects which can be associated with concussions. More importantly, the risk of not telling and being able to play in one more sporting event is not anywhere near the reward of preserving your long term health, as that is a very critical factor in life.",c3,186
R_5Ayd6LihT91XYq1,"This video tells what can happen when you get a concussion and don't tell anyone. Your health is the most important thing and insuring that by diagnosing any head injury is a good idea. always tell because missing one event will have minimal impacts on your life going forward compared to missing a whole season or altering your personality because of the event.    If there is any question about a head injury, it doesn't pay to ""tough it out"", there is no toughing it out with head injuries. you brain is bleeding and until that stops all the symptoms are only going to get worse and worse and the chances of severe injury from the concussion go up as well.",c3,120
R_eRlB5eb1DEwoUSx,"Connor,  If you ever end up getting a concussion sometime in the future, remember the messages from the video. Remember the two choices you have, and all of the negative impacts that could come from not telling anyone about your concussion. Remember that your health supersedes any competition, schoolwork, or job interview that you might have scheduled in the near future. Also, by telling someone and getting proper treatment, you will actually be back to full health faster anyways, so it is a double win.  Also remember that if someone you are close to experiences an event where they think they might have received a concussion, encourage them to report it and get help. People are generally more likely to do something beneficial for themselves if they have the support of their friends/teammates/family, instead of having those same people nagging on them for being ""too soft"" or telling them to ""play through it"".",c3,153

I hope I never have another concussion but if I do I know I need to tell somebody. Especially in the first couple days, that is when it was the worst.   Concussions are extremely dangerous and I know the importance of reporting them. If I report that I think I may have a concussion I will get tested to know for sure and receive the treatment I need for it.

If you don't remember, I will lay out some of the main points again because it is imperative that you follow these tips. First, know the symptoms of a concussion. Some may include dizziness, light headedness, headaches, not being able to focus, sensitivity to light, etc. However, it may be a few days before some of these symptoms onset. Second, if you take any blow to the head that you may have thought could have been a concussion, please report it. Even if you experience a hit to the head, but don't initially feel any symptoms, please report it still. It is very important to start the healing process and is the quickest way to get you back to normal.    These two things are very important to remember in your life because you may experience concussions in everyday activities and not just through sports. Even though you may not be playing any hard hitting contact sports like football, concussions can still occur and it is very important that you monitor your health and report a concussion if you believe you have suffered one. Your life and health are way more important than playing in any sporting event while you have a concussion. It is just not worth it. It can affect your schooling, your work and disrupt your entire life. You have too many years left on your life filled with a possible wife and kids, don't let the stereotypes of being a man and fighting through pain get in the way of that. Please report any symptoms you may feel or experience, your life depends on it.     Your future self,   Chris",c3,305
R_e5TCJjkQbNUrvIV,"First off, concussion symptoms are not always obvious.  You don't have to pass out/ knocked out for a concussion to occur.  The more you ask your brain to do after an injury will make things worse, e.g. videogames, homework. Common signs are light and noise are bothersome, feel kind of ""off"", feel slowed down, takes longer to solve problems or think of words you're looking for.  Screens and books can also be hard to look at when you have a concussion.  Final list:  headache, nausea, difficulty concentrating, balance issues, double/fuzzy vision, feeling sluggish, foggy, or groggy, slowed reactions, feeling unusually irritable, and trouble with memory like confusion or amnesia.    Important, if you think there is any possibility of having a concussion, move yourself out of any situtations that could cause blows to the head or stress yourself unnecessarily.

R_bIRDddLkJlLpyKN,In the future I hope to remember the positives of speaking up about concussion symptoms. I have experienced the feeling of not wanting to speak up because I felt like I needed to push through it for my team. After watching this video it has helped emphasize that I am putting myself through a high unnecessary risk that could potentially hurt my team more than reporting symptoms.  I also hope to remember that second impact is a serious possibility. In the sport I play (hockey) if I put my self in the situation of pushing through a concussion it would not take much to get hit the same way again. To put my team in that situation would be irresponsible of me as a teammate and as a friend. The better option in almost every scenario is to speak up about symptoms because everyone around you is there to help.,c3,150

I hope you remember the significant downsides of not telling anyone about your symptoms so that you will understand how much worse the concussion can get.    If you remember to speak out about the symptoms you are experiencing, you will be able to have a full recovery and get back to playing the game sooner. In addition, you will perform better academically. Don't be afraid to voice what you are feeling because in the long run, your health is so much more important than playing a game.

Anyway, your past self just watched a video about concussions. None of this information was new and I expect that you treat concussions as you always have. If you forgot, concussions are serious and you should continue to stop everything and seek advice if you ever display any concussion-like symptoms..    Remember in college when all lacrosse players were required to take an Impact test when they first started playing? This test served as a baseline for diagnosing a concussion. We also had coaches and trainers who would instruct players to take an impact test if they were involved in any big hits or displayed any symptoms. Wouldn't this be a great thing to implement for all activities that are high-risk for concussions?    Hopefully in the future, Rec Sports has better concussion resources available to their athletes. It kind of ridiculous that coaches have no training in preventing concussions and knowing when to keep players out of practice. Remember when Mike played the rest of a lacrosse game, and has zero recollection of the entire second half because of a concussion?    Hopefully you're happy and still playing lacrosse!    <3  Past Self",c1,213

You are not tough when you choose not to report a concussion, and you are most certainly not considered weak when you report a possible concussion. You will not be looked down on by your teammates or coaches if you choose to report a possible concussion. Moreover, a good coach or teammate would you want you to report it anyway.     Think about the repercussions for not reporting a concussion; you could do serious harm to your health long term. Something as simple as a talk to a trainer about a concussion could prevent losing serious mental capacity.

In rugby (and I'm sure in many other sports) the drive to play through any injuries is strong.  And especially at the club level, where we have limited subs to come on, the pressure to stay in the game is fierce.  However, you'll be worse off by staying in, and moreover, your team will be worse off.

If you do not report the injury there are pretty intense repercussions for deciding to not let someone know. Things like mental illness and even a possibility of death are not of the question when concerning an untreated concussion.  Overall, I think it is probably a better idea to at the very least alert someone that you may think you have a concussion if that situation every arises. The consequences of not doing so greatly outweigh simply being vocal about any problems that you have.",c3,112

If you don't tell anyone you might have a concussion and just wait to see if the symptoms disappear by themselves, it may lead to severe consequences, like prolonging the recovery process, performing worse at sports or even at academics and personal relationships. Also, you may have greater risks for dementia or other mental health problems.    On the other hand, if you tell someone, a doctor may check your symptoms and give you proper treatment if you truly have a concussion. The rest period may be only 24 to 48 hours.",c3,104

Any disorientation felt after a blow to a head should be reported to a professional. Not telling anyone about a possible concussion only has negative effects. Telling someone can only lead to a better life.    It's better for me to simply tell someone about anything weird after hitting my head. It'll be much better for me in the short and long run.,c3,85

I only get one of each, and those allow me to be who I am, enjoy the life I have, and experience the future.

I get common headaches, so it may be difficult to determine a concussion that way, but through difficulty concentrating, dizziness, or nausea, I may be able to detect it early.  Additionally, the most important thing that I want to remember is that playing on a concussion, or even studying and watching TV with a concussion, can make the injury even worse.

Yeah, it might just be that pervasive Friday morning hangover. Sometimes you just have an off day.    Hangovers don't happen when you didn't drink the night before. You can't still have a headache from the Super Smash sesh three nights prior. You're an active and alert dude. You don't have medical conditions that induce spontaneous headaches and you don't have trouble concentrating and you're not an aggressive or confrontational person.

I will not try to tough it out and I will not try to suppress the symptoms to avoid being taken out of competition or life.    To take action immediately is the right thing to do.

If you choose to not tell someone, there are many additional risks that come into play that can make your concussion even more of a (long term) issue. For example, if you choose not to tell, the situation may become worse by you feeling miserable and exposing yourself to a higher risk of depression, anxiety and self-doubt. Additionally, it is certain that your athletic, social and academic performance will become poorer, and you may not be able to return to your former performance level. You also put yourself at a greater risk for future injuries, some as serious as dementia or even death if a second impact occurs, and you increase your recovery time significantly.    On the other hand, if you choose to tell someone, a professional will assess your symptoms and diagnose you appropriately. Consequently, you will receive proper treatment, and will be able to give your brain time to recover. After a relatively short period of time, you will be able to return to your activity and compete again, and your life will be back to normal.",c3,202

That being said, I really hope you don't get a concussion again.  You've been doing well avoiding contact sports and focusing on lifting and throwing (maybe that's because of your knees too), so keep that up.  There's no reason to risk getting another concussion and ruining your future just to play a contact sport again.  Have fun with what you do, but be careful.

There is not harm and no one will look down on a player for being checked for a concussion, and if it isn't one there is probably another reason you don't feel yourself and that reason should also be addressed.     The sooner after a concussion occurs that it is diagnosed, the sooner you can begin to properly recover, and that leads to a faster and more likely a complete recovery. Waiting will just prolongs the symptoms, decreases quality of life, and can become very dangerous in the future if another injury to the head is sustained.

Continuing to play with a concussion can lead to further injury, further brain damage, and can prevent you from returning to your normal caliber of play.  Not letting your brain recover after a concussion can cause issues that may affect your personal relationships, your health, and your potential to work.    However, reporting a concussion can prevent many of these side effects from happening.  By being diagnosed and receiving proper treatment, you can allow your brain to recover.  This means that you ma return to activity and your sport faster and will likely have fewer issues down the road.  It is important to get checked so that you don't put our brain and body at risk of further injury.  It is better to get checked out if you aren't sure than to wait it out.",c3,152

Like she said, it is better to tell someone if you think you have a concussion (healthcare professional) to confirm concussion then right treatment which includes rest. Then you will have quicker return to sport/life.    If you don't heed this advice there is a lot of problems that can arise. Some consequences include higher chance of depression , anxiety and self-doubt, lower performance level (sports and career), and greater risk of other injury.

It is better to miss a couple games to improve your health than an entire season or even give up the game for life.  I have had several friends who have had multiple concussions and cannot play their sport anymore because of the risk of another concussion.  Telling someone decreases the time of recovery, so you can go back to playing again sooner.    In addition to athletics, academics are extremely important, even more important than sports to me, and concussions can affect academic performance.

Remember, a loss of consciousness is not necessary to receive a concussion.    Don't ignore symptoms--always report them to your coach or a health professional.

Don't do that thing you did that one time when you hit your head, twice, and didn't do anything but sit out for a round because guess what, you're not invincible, and just because you've never had to go out on long term injury before doesn't mean you'll never have to.

They obviously can be caused by a direct hit to the head, but they can also occur when hitting the ground too hard, i.e. and indirect hit to the head. Obvious symptoms include amnesia and loss of consciousness, but more discreet symptoms can include lightheadedness, dizziness, confusion, lack of focus - so if any of these occur after taking a hit, it's important to sit out instead of hurting your brain even more.    Playing rugby, it's incredibly important to be attuned to these symptoms. After hitting the ground, it's easy to have the wind knocked out of you and think ""this is normal,"" when immediately getting a bit dizzy or lightheaded. Persistent symptoms are very serious, though, and can lead to even further damage if not taken care of properly.

Sometimes, light and loud noises hurt you because of this overstimulation of the brain. Trouble remembering things and feeling confused is common. The brain needs to rest when you concur a concussion. Exercise, studying, and video games could make symptoms worse.

Also even if you play through a potential concussion you're not only making it harder for you to get better but you're also not playing your best and won't be able to preform well in your sport, in school and any other activities.    Some important symptoms to watch for if you believe you have a concussion are to watch how you feel immediately after the impact or even after a few days.

If all of these physical, emotional, and mental effects are not enough to deter someone from not reporting their concussion, the possibility of death due to a second impact should be enough to scare them into reporting their symptoms. Most commonly, it is not the first concussion that does the most damage, but the second.
